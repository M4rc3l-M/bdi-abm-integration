This software realises a mechanism for integrating
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) reasoning into agents within an
agent-based simulation (ABM). The concept is described
in the following papers:

## How to use this software

Examples of BDI-ABM applications are provided in the `./examples` directory.

Any BDI-ABM application consists of three layers. A generic first layer
(`./integrations/bdi-abm`) manages the high level interaction and message
passing between the BDI and the ABM system. A second platform specific
layer realises the connection between a specific BDI platform (such as
JACK, i.e., `./integrations/abm-jack`), and a specific ABM system (such
as MATSim, i.e., `./integrations/bdi-matsim`). Finally, a third application
layer puts these together along with domain specific code (for instance
`./examples/bushfire).

Overall, the repository consists of *integrations* and *examples*. Integrations
are platform specific and live in `./integrations`. Examples are domain
specific, and live in `./examples`. The following integrations
are provided:

Integration   | Directory                   | Description
:-------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------
BDI-ABM       | `./integrations/bdi-abm`    | BDI-ABM communication and data layer
BDI-GAMS      | `./integrations/bdi-gams`   | Integration for GAMS (www.gams.com)
BDI-MATSim    | `./integrations/bdi-matsim` | Integration for MATSim (www.matsim.org)
ABM-JACK      | `./integrations/abm-jack`   | Integration for JACK (aosgrp.com/products/jack)
ABM-Jill      | `./integrations/abm-jill`   | Integration for Jill (http://agentsoz.github.io/jill)
ABM-Jadex     | `./integrations/abm-jadex`  | Integration for Jadex (http://www.activecomponents.org/bin/view/About/Features)

Integrations are pulled together to build application examples. The following
examples are provided:

Example             | Directory                      | Description
:-------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------
Bushfire            | `./examples/bushfire`          | Uses Jill and MATSim
Bushfire Tutorial   | `./examples/bushfire-tutorial` | Uses JACK and MATSim
Conservation Ethics | `./examples/conservation`      | Uses Jill and GAMS
Child Vaccination   | `./examples/vaccination`       | Uses JACK and a custom Python-based ABM

In addition to above, the repository consists of an *util* project. It lives in
`./util` and contains the utility classes used by integration libraries and example
applications in the repository.

Project     | Directory      | Description
:-----------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------
Util        | `./util`       | Contains utility classes for integration libraries and example applications

## Build Dependencies


* Java Development Kit 1.8
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit

* Apache Maven 3.3.*
  http://maven.apache.org

* Some of the integrations (e.g., JACK, GAMS) require third-party
  libraries to be installed in your local Maven repository. See
  the respective READMEs (`./integrations/*/README.md`) for details.
  *The project will not build unless these dependencies have been
   resolved.*
